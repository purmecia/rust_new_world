# Countdown Timer

A simple countdown timer written in Rust that counts down from a given number of seconds.

## Getting Started

To run the program, make sure you have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

## Running the Countdown Timer

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `cargo run` to build and execute the program.

## Usage

Enter the duration for the countdown in seconds and press Enter. The program will then count down to zero and display "Time's up!" when the countdown is complete.

Example:

```
Enter the duration for the countdown in seconds:
5
5 seconds remaining...
4 seconds remaining...
3 seconds remaining...
2 seconds remaining...
1 seconds remaining...
Time's up!
```
